ScreenToMap

Using this Spigot Plugin you can mirror parts of your screen onto a minecraft map.

Usage

Use the command /screentomap first. This will give you the map. At first it will say "NO SIGNAL". Then, using "/screentomap cfg <x> <y> <width> <height>" you can define the rectangle that will be displayed onto your map. If you want your full screen, just enter "/screentomap cfg 0 0 1920 1080".
